# Description
This is my solution to a task given in **Team Interplanetar's software subteam recruitment** in **2021**. These codes are based on raw OpenCV based operations, not taking help of machine learning or other computation heavy algorithms. 

Follow [this post](https://sheriffmelamine.github.io/posts/a-simple-opencv/)) in my personal website where I have explained in details how one of the code works. Other code is slight extension to that code, which is for the bonus task to determine the mid-point between two AR Tags.
